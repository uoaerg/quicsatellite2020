  <meta name="description" content="The purpose of this meeting is to provide a short update on the latest 
standards status of the new IETF QUIC transport protocol and its 
implications on design and operation of SATCOM systems. After a brief 
overview of various work in progress, there will be a discussion of what 
needs to happen next.

QUIC is the next generation of web protocol, and includes HTTP/3. 
Already a significant proportion of network traffic, QUIC usage is set 
to significantly increase as the IETF publishes the specifications as an 
RFC in early 2021.  QUIC is a new connection-oriented protocol being 
specified by the IETF. It provides an extensible transport improving 
performance for web and other traffic, and adding support for connection 
migration. Importantly, QUIC - in contrast to TCP - encrypts and 
authenticates all header fields, providing enhanced privacy and 
security.  This design prevents existing methods to enhance satellite 
network performance - such as unauthenticated PEPs, compression, DPI for 
QoS, and other cross-layer enhancements.

Initial designs of QUIC have focussed on the significant benefits in 
common deployment scenarios for web traffic. The QUIC and Satellite Open 
Stakeholder Meeting will examine performance when using an internet path 
that includes a satellite communication (SATCOM) network.

As the first IETF specifications are published, there is a unique 
opportunity to influence the design and deployment of this new protocol. 
QUIC also provides opportunities to influence the emerging 
specifications and promote extensions, which if widely supported, could 
offer significant benefit to satellite services. People attending the 
meeting  are invited to join an open discussion of what is now needed by 
the satellite communications sector, what additional requirements are 
important, how people can collaborate on research, how people can bring 
work to the IETF, and finally what steps might be taken to increase 
stakeholder engagement in the next steps from the satellite 
communications sector.

This is an open meeting organised by the ESA MTAILS project 
(https://artes.esa.int/projects/mtails). All participants do have to 
register on-line before they can join the meeting.
